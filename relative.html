    <h1>Relative Positioning</h1>
    <h2>Using position: relative;</h2>

<ul>-An element with <strong>position: relative;</strong> is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.</ul>
<ul>-When you move an element using its top, right, bottom, or left properties, it's like taking it out of a line and shifting it. The empty space it leaves behind is still there, and the other elements don't move to fill it. </ul>
<ul>-This has position: relative, and is skewed 30 px to the right of its normal position</ul>

<div class="relative-page">
This div element has position: relative;
</div>
